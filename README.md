# nano-castle
- Cute little shell script that prints out a tiny castle.
- This script was made in nano, the built-in command-line text editor.
- This README.md file was edited in nano as well.
- The script was updated to clear and re-print the castle at 60 fps--effectively laying the foundation for some simple animation.
